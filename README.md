# frc-cad
bad frc cadding (top tier frc cadders number one fear)

# session 1:
i wanted to make a full frc robot (that may look good on paper but will probably go badly in real life), without knowing how to (it's bound to go well.) i decided to start this by planning what kind of frc robot i wanted to make. after like 15 minute of pondering and looking at game animations, i chose 2020/2021, because it looks easy (probably isn't.) 
i then scoured chief delphi for different types of subsystems and pick the ones that i want/would be feasible for me to cad/would be effective

this one is by 971, Spartan Robotics, but i can't really get a good idea of how their hopper kinda works, but their intake, indexing and shooting i can kinda understand.
https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/frc-6328-mechanical-advantage-2020-2021-build-thread/370409/139 
this one is from 6328, Mechanical Advantage, and i can get a good picture of how it works, since they show cad pictures and i think have a cad file to look at. 
https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/team-4414-hightide-2021-robot-onshore/392989/1
this one is from 4414, Hightide, and i don't know which robot is their main robot. i can see their intaking and shooting but not much of indexing/hoppers.

this one is from 95, The Grasshoppers, and they provided an onshape link which helps me in seeing how their robot works. it also kinda takes a long time to load.
https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/team-254-presents-dreadnought-2020-2021-technical-binder-q-a/395066/1
this one is from 254, The Cheezy Poofs, and a tech binder, where they explain how their robot works/how different subsystems work.
https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/2910-ir-h-robot-design/391977/1
this one is from 2910, they have a grabcad i think, and they have a good picture of their robot, and i can see how their shooting, indexing and intaking works.

there's also 1678's cad release, they also cadded a bunch of other robots, so i can look at them if i need to check some things. 
i think that i'll be diong something like 2910's indexer, since 971's indexer is a bit tall. i also think that 6238's hopper design is good, since it looks simple and easy to do (watch as it's extremely hard) a bunch of these teams also used a shooter that could change the angle that it would shoot at, but i  think that's way above my skill level. maybe if i get better, i could do it, but i don't entirely know if i can, so i think i'll just be doing a fixed angle shooter. intaking is also quite interesting, i'm  not sure what i want to do for that just yet, but i think it'll be over the bumper, since through the bumper probably won't go too well for me, and i don't want to cut an entire section of a drivebase out (and i'm  not sure how swerve would go with it.)
also, i'll probably visit 254's tech binder quite a bit, since it goes into some detail about strategy n stuff.
